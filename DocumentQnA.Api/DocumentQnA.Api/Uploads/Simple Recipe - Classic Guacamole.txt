**Classic Guacamole Recipe**

This simple recipe yields a delicious, fresh guacamole perfect for dipping.

**Ingredients:**
* 3 ripe avocados
* 1/2 small red onion, finely diced
* 1-2 jalapeños, seeded and minced (adjust to taste)

**Instructions:**
1.  **Prepare Avocados:** Cut avocados in half, remove pits, and scoop the flesh into a medium bowl.
2.  **Mash:** Lightly mash the avocados with a fork or potato masher, leaving some chunks for texture.
3.  **Combine:** Add the diced red onion, minced jalapeños, chopped cilantro, lime juice, and salt to the bowl.
4.  **Mix:** Gently fold all ingredients together. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
5.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with tortilla chips, or cover tightly with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole to prevent browning, and refrigerate for up to 2 hours.
